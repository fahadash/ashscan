R&amp;D Project to stop bad guys on IRC Chat rooms

It is a basic bot with configuration parameters in app.config. It checks against DNS-BLs, Banned Hostlists, word abuse in nicknames.

The app is currently not fully stable. We would appreciate your help.

Special thanks to SirCmpwn for his ChatSharp repository which really made this possible.
