R&amp;D Project to stop bad guys on IRC Chat rooms, A good exercise to fight hackers.

It is a basic bot with configuration parameters in app.config. It checks against DNS-BLs, Banned Hostlists, word abuse in nicknames. Working on this project can help you exercise the realtime data processing a bit as well as how attackers and abusers use exploit to their advantage and what can we do to stop them.

The app is currently not fully stable. We would appreciate your help.

Special thanks to SirCmpwn for his ChatSharp repository which really made this possible.
